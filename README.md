# Micro Compiler

by Vic Cortes, published in RUN 07/86

Compiled to Javascript using MOSpeed by EgonOlsen71

Originally coded in BASIC V2, this is a so called "micro compiler" for the Commodore 64.
It compiles a sub-set of BASIC V2 into quite fast machine code. You can find more details
in the (german) description from back in the days, which has been included in the project.

This version has been compiled from BASIC V2 into Javascript using MOSpeed.
So it runs and compiles natively in your browser.

To use it, just download the project and open the index.html in your browser.
The basic-directory contains the original sources (with the bas-version being slightly modified).
These aren't needed just to run the program.
