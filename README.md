# Micro Compiler

by Vic Cortes, published in RUN 07/86

Compiled to Javascript and Python using MOSpeed by EgonOlsen71

Originally coded in BASIC V2, this is a so called "micro compiler" for the Commodore 64.
It compiles a sub-set of BASIC V2 into quite fast machine code. You can find more details
in the (german) description from back in the days, which has been included in the project.

This version has been compiled from BASIC V2 into Javascript using MOSpeed.
So it runs and compiles natively in your browser.

It has also been compiled to Python, so that it runs in your terminal with Python installed.

To use the Javascript version, just download the project and open the index.html in js/ in your browser.
To use the Python version, run mc.py in python/.
The basic-directory contains the original sources. The js/ and the python/ directories 
contain slightly modified versions for the corresponding platforms.
These aren't needed just to run the program.
